# Fusion360-class

This repo is the develoment and student acccess space for a FUsion 360 class I am developing. The class is divided into multiple "modules", each intended to be a session of 1-2 hours.  The overall class is intended to start with the very basics of Fusion 360 and eventually cover all the aspects of Fusion 360 that I have learned and regularly use.

The teaching plan for each module is to discuss the topics to be shared with the students while showing on-line at the same time, while every student is also running Fusion360 and following along. 

This repository is divided into folders for each module, and each folder will eventually contain a description of the module, class notes, example files for students to download, etc as I see fit to add.


A bit about me... I retired in 2019 after spend 39 years in the development of computers. I've done product developement and mechanical part design, engineering management, and architected servers used in big data centers at Amazon and Microsoft. Blah, blah, blah, work, blah blah blah, retirement. Now, I like solving puzzles and making things. I picked up Fusion 360 after I retired so I could make parts to 3D print in my garage. I watched tutorials on-line and worked my way up the learning curve with FUsion 360. Now I want to lend a hand to others interesting in climbing that same hill. I think I can share some things that will let people avoid some of the potholes I triped over.
