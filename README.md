# Fusion360-class

This repo is the develoment and student acccess space for a FUsion 360 class I am developing. The class is divided into multiple "modules", each intended to be a session of 1-2 hours.  The overall class is intended to start with the very basics of Fusion 360 and eventually cover all the aspects of Fusion 360 that I have learned and regularly use.

The teaching plan for each module is to discuss the topics to be shared with the students while showing on-line at the same time, while every student is also running Fusion360 and following along. 

This repository is divided into folders for each module, and each folder will eventually contain a description of the module, class notes, example files for students to download, etc as I see fit to add.
