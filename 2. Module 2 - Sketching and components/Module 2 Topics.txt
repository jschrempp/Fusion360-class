Module 2 - God methods for making things  1 hour
	
	Components vs bodies
		Bodies
			- just 3D shapes within a component
			- can be saved as an stl
		Components
			-What you make when you start FUsion 360
			- a wholly contained part that is a separate "container" 
				- has its own coordinate system
				- has its own material
				- can have its own sketches
				- has its own bodies
				- Can contain other components
			- Can be assembled to other parts using joints
			- can be exported as a Fusion file
			- can be inserted into other fusion designs
		Importing stl objects	
	
	Sketching strategies and techniques
		- master sketches
		- Constraints
			- What are "constraints" and why are they important
			- Fusion assumed constraints and constraints you place
			- Constraint icons and how to use them
			- "Fully constrained" sketches and why you dont always need to be fully constrained
		- points on top of other points - which one gets used for the constraint? Avoid this hassle
		- fix/unfix
		- hole to egde - dimensioning center vs to a tangent line
		- constraining holes
		- patterns 
		- mirroring
		- dimensioning - avoid points where practical
		- projections
		- Start by drawing it out of proportion and not too close to other things


	Example - door hinge
