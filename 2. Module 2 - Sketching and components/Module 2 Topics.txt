Module 2 - Start making stuff - Components and Sketching
	
	Components vs bodies
		Bodies
			- "just a 3D solid"
			- just 3D shapes within a component
			- can be saved as an stl file, or imported from an stl file
		Components - "THE" Fusion 360 model 
			- The minimum Fusion 360 "thing"
			- A container for a design (or part of a design)
				- has its own coordinate system
				- Can have:
					- Its own material
					- Its own sketches
					- Its own bodies
				- Can contain other components
					- And joints between them
			- Can be assembled to other parts using joints
			- Can be exported as a Fusion file
			- Can be inserted into other fusion designs
	
	Sketching strategies and techniques
		- Master sketches
		- Constraints
			- What are "constraints" and why are they important
			- Fusion assumed constraints and constraints you place
			- Constraint icons and how to use them
			- "Fully constrained" sketches and why you dont always need to be fully constrained
		- Fix/unfix	
		
		- points on top of other points - which one gets used for the constraint? Avoid this hassle
		- hole to egde - dimensioning center vs to a tangent line
		- constraining holes
		- patterns 
		- mirroring
		- dimensioning - avoid points where practical
		- projections
		- Start by drawing it out of proportion and not too close to other things


	Example - door hinge
