Module 2 - Start making stuff - Components and Sketching
	
	Components vs bodies
		Bodies
			- "just a 3D solid"
			- just 3D shapes within a component
			- can be saved as an stl file, or imported from an stl file
		Components - "THE" Fusion 360 model 
			- The minimum Fusion 360 "thing"
			- A container for a design (or part of a design)
				- has its own coordinate system
				- Can have:
					- Its own material
					- Its own sketches
					- Its own bodies
				- Can contain other components
					- And joints between them
			- Can be assembled to other parts using joints
			- Can be exported as a Fusion file
			- Can be inserted into other fusion designs
	
	Sketching strategies and techniques
		- Where sketches live in the browser 
			- always in a component
			- I like most sketches to live in the component they are for
			- I put "master sketches" outside components
			- Name your sketches if there are a lot of them.
		
		- Line types in sketches
			- Regular lines 
			- Construction lines
			- Lines (or arcs) are "intifite" and also ended by points
			- Projected lines (linked or unlinked) - purple unless they are broken, then orange. 
			
		- The create menu
		
		-The modify menu
		
		- Constraints
			- What are "constraints" and why are they important
			- Fix/unfix - the strongest constraint - fixed items areshow in green.
			- Fusion assumed constraints and constraints you place
			- Constraint types - 
				- Dimensions
				- Geometric constraints
			- Constraint icons on your sketch and how to use them
			- "Fully constrained" sketches and why you dont always need to be fully constrained
			
		- My sketching best practices
			- More geometric constraints, fewer dimensions
			- Constructions lines are really helpful
			- Avoid dimensioning to points
			- Avoid "coincident" circle centers, bettter to use concentric
			- Use a hole to lock your constraints, not the origin. 
			- hole to edge - dimensioning center vs to a tangent line
			- Start by drawing it out of proportion and not too close to other things
