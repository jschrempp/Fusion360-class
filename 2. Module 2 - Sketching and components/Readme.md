## Module 2 - Components and Sketching

In this module, we'll cover two major topics which will help new Fusion360 users make better designs.

### Fusion 360 Component model

The component model (at least, that's what I call it), is valuable to understand because "components" are the most basic building blocks of a Fusion design.  You can do a lot with Fusion without  understanding the component model, but your designs will be cleaner (and you'll probably be less frustrated) if you understand the component model.



### Sketching Techniques

Sketches are at the core of designing in Fusion360, and my aim in this part of the module is to show some of the things that I've learned that I think make my sketches better. We'll talk about where in your design you can put sketches, "constraints" and why they are important, what a "fully constrained" sketch is and why you don't always need it, and walk though many of the most useful sketching tools. 



### Learning by doing

During the class we'll design a door-hinge to show and practice what we're learning.
