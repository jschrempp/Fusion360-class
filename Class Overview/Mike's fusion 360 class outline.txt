 Module 1 - The very basics- 2 hours
	Tour of the user interface
		- Data panel
			- Projects, folders within projects
			- Libraries
			- Samples
		Component Browser
		Timeline
		Workspaces (Design, genreative Design, Render, ANimation, SImulation, Manufacture, Drawing)
			menu ribbon and sub-menus
		user preferences
		menus at the bottom
		
	Fusion 360 uses a "component" model
		- Every design starts as a single component. When you save the design the top level component gets that same name
		- Components can also be created under the top level component. 
			- These have all the same properties as the top level component.
			- These can be exported from Fusion as "complete Fusion 360 designs.
			- You can have multiple levels of sub components in your design (which is a good practive if you have a lot of parts)
		- As the design is created, "folders" are created within any component to contain stuff like 
			- sketches: 2D diagrams used to capture details of the design. 
			- bodies: solid 3D entities
			- joint otigins: user defined places where parts will connect to other parts
			- Connections between components that are part of this component.
			- Sub-components.
		- For any component other than the top level, rename it by double clicking on it. 
		- When you create new things (bodies, sketches, etc) they are located in the "currently active componnet"
			- The active component will be shown as a solid and other parts at the same level or above it will be in wireframe outline.
			- The active component is indicated by a filled in circle to the right of it's name.
	
	Steps in a Fusion 360 design (for a 3D printed part, but most of this applies to other design too)
		- Make a new component (or skip if your design has only one part)
		- Make one or more sketches
		- use the sketch with some tools to make solid bodies
		- make more sketches to add details to the body
		- Merge bodies as you go along, or at the end
		- Put finishing touches on your body using the modify tools
		- do the above steps for each part
		- Call it "first prototype" and save the final body for each part as an STL file
		- Print it and test it, then retun to Fusion to adjust as needed based on testing.
		
	Where is my part file stored
		- In the Fusion cloud
			- In your personal workspace
			- In a team space you control
			- In a team space someone else controls (if you have a pro license)
		- All saved versions of your design in teh cloud are preserved unless you delete them. 
		- On your personal computer (if you export the design)
		

	Making a simple thing with two parts - A drink coaster : PLA main part sitting on TPU feet
		Create a component names "coaster"
			Create a sketch for the main part. 
				- Make a squareish  shape with 4 lines
				- Constrain the lines into a quadra-lateral
				- Add four circles for the feet locations
				- Fix one circle
				- Constrain the corners to be perpendicular
				- Add dimensions and additional constraints until it is fully constrained.
			Extrude to 3mm thick
		Create acomponent named foot
			- sketch and extrude
		Copy foot 3 times
		Join feet to based
		
	Recommended homework
		



Getting the most from Fusion


Module 2 - Good methods for making things  1 hour
	Sketching strategies and techniques
		- master sketches
		- Constraints
			- What are "constraints" and ewhya re they important
			- Fusion assumed constraints and constraints you place
			- Constrain icons and how to use them
			- "Fully constrained" sketches and why you dont always need to be fully constrained
		- points on top of other points - which one gets sued for teh constraint? Avoid this hassle
		- fix/unfix
		- hole to egde - dimensioning center vs to a tangent line
		- constraining holes
		- patterns 
		- mirroring
		- dimensioning - avoid points where practical
		- projections
		- Start by drawing it out of proportion and not too close to other things

	Components vs bodies
		Bodies
			- just 3D shapes within a component
			- can be saved as an stl
		Components
			-What you make when you start FUsion 360
			- a wholly contained part that is a separate "container" 
				- has it's own coordinate system
				- has it's own material
				- can have it's own sketches
				- has it's own bodies
				- Can contain other components
			- Can be assembled to other parts using joints
			- can be exported as a Fusion file
			- can be inserted into other fusion designs
		Importing stl objects
	
	Example -  door hinge

Module 3 - The lazy designer - Take control 1 hour
	Partameterized designs
		- F360 is a "Parametric Design System". means everything is built up step by step and those steps are recorded. You can change something in an early step and changes will repple thorugh the rest of your design. 
		This is kind of like an advanced "undo" function, where you don't have to back up each step, but can jump back in time to change something you wish you did differently
		 - Making bodies directly (and why it usually isnt a good idea.
	
	The timeline is your friend
	
	Example - 3D printable allen wrench handles
	 

Module 4 - Connecting to the real world 60 minutes
	Modeling existing devices
		- A strategy for practicing Fusion 360 (like playing an existing song on the piano before you try to compose your own).
		- Good tools to have - Calipers, camera


	Using a canvas to capture a shape.
		- The parallax problem adn how to deal with it (I like GIMP)
		- tracing shapes
