## Module 1 - Fusion360 - Getting Started

This folder is where class information and material for the first module will be, when I get it in place.  

The first class will focus on the brand new user, and so there will be more "lecturing" and less "doing" than I plan for most of the modules in this series.  We'll walk through a lot of the features in the user interface, with me trying to explain what they are for and when it's important to learn them.
