 Module 1 - The very basics- 2 hours
	Fusion 360 is a Parametric Design system - wtf does that mean?
	
	Tour of the user interface
		- Data panel
			- Projects, folders within projects
			- Libraries
			- Samples
		Component Browser
		Timeline
		Workspaces (Design, genreative Design, Render, ANimation, SImulation, Manufacture, Drawing)
			menu ribbon and sub-menus
		user preferences
		menus at the bottom
		
	Fusion 360 uses a "component" model
		- Every design starts as a single component. When you save the design the top level component gets that same name
		- Components can also be created under the top level component. 
			- These have all the same properties as the top level component.
			- These can be exported from Fusion as "complete Fusion 360 designs.
			- You can have multiple levels of sub components in your design (which is a good practive if you have a lot of parts)
		- As the design is created, "folders" are created within any component to contain stuff like 
			- sketches: 2D diagrams used to capture details of the design. 
			- bodies: solid 3D entities
			- joint otigins: user defined places where parts will connect to other parts
			- Connections between components that are part of this component.
			- Sub-components.
		- For any component other than the top level, rename it by double clicking on it. 
		- When you create new things (bodies, sketches, etc) they are located in the "currently active componnet"
			- The active component will be shown as a solid and other parts at the same level or above it will be in wireframe outline.
			- The active component is indicated by a filled in circle to the right of it's name.
	
	Steps in a Fusion 360 design (for a 3D printed part, but most of this applies to other design too)
		- Make a new component (or skip if your design has only one part)
		- Make one or more sketches
		- use the sketch with some tools to make solid bodies
		- make more sketches to add details to the body
		- Merge bodies as you go along, or at the end
		- Put finishing touches on your body using the modify tools
		- do the above steps for each part
		- Call it "first prototype" and save the final body for each part as an STL file
		- Print it and test it, then retun to Fusion to adjust as needed based on testing.
		
	Where is my part file stored
		- In the Fusion cloud
			- In your personal workspace
			- In a team space you control
			- In a team space someone else controls (if you have a pro license)
		- All saved versions of your design in teh cloud are preserved unless you delete them. 
		- On your personal computer (if you export the design)
	
	The right-click
	The three button mouse

	Making a simple thing with two parts - A drink coaster : PLA main part sitting on TPU feet
		Create a component names "coaster"
			Create a sketch for the main part. 
				- Make a squareish  shape with 4 lines
				- Constrain the lines into a quadra-lateral
				- Add four circles for the feet locations
				- Fix one circle
				- Constrain the corners to be perpendicular
				- Add dimensions and additional constraints until it is fully constrained.
			Extrude to 3mm thick
		Create acomponent named foot
			- sketch and extrude
		Copy foot 3 times
		Join feet to based
		
	Recommended homework
